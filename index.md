I am a Ph.D candidate in robotics and optimization at Stanford University. 

My research focuses on developing fast optimization algorithms for simulation, planning, and control for robotic systems. I am designing and implementing a differentiable physics simulator and leveraging this tool for trajectory tracking, planning and reinforcement learning tasks in robotic locomotion and manipulation. Previously, I implemented optimization algorithms enabling game-theoretic reasoning for autonomous vehicles.
